I want to write a Spring Boot application for Spring Cloud Data Flow that will watch a HDFS directory for new files.

The application should:
- Scan the HDFS directory for new files on a regular interval
- Create a webHDFS URL for each new file and place it on a Spring Cloud Data Flow stream (rabbitmq)
- the application name is hdfsWatcher and is in package com.baskettecase.hdfsWatcher
- the application should be a Spring Boot application
- the application should be a Spring Cloud Data Flow application
- have 2 modes.
    - Standalone mode which allows me to pass the HDFS information via app properties and receive the webhdfs urls to the terminal
    - Stream mode which will create a stream that will place the webhdfs urls on a rabbitmq queue
    

When creating the stream which will instantiate the application we will pass the following parameters:
- hdfsPath: the path of the hdfs directory to watch
- pollInterval: the interval in seconds to poll the hdfs directory for new files
- hdfsUri: the uri of the hdfs cluster
- hdfsUser: the user to use when accessing hdfs

Use instructions.txt for instructions on how to create the application
